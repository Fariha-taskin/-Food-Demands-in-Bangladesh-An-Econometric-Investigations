## Overview
This project was done while I was a research associate in the Economic Research Platform (ERP) at North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

## Introduction
<div align= "justify"> The primary objective of this study is to investigate the food demand responsiveness in Bangladesh. More specifically, using the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) with the appropriate Stone Price Index, the paper estimates income (expenditure) and price elasticities of demand for ten composite food products in Bangladesh, namely, Cereals, Fish, Meat, Pulses, Edible oil, Milk, Vegetables, Fruits, Spices, and Other. This study also utilizes the most recent data from the 2016 Household Income and Expenditure Survey undertaken by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics which will help the policymakers to have a better idea while making policies. The results seem to suggest that Fish, Meat, Fruits, Spices, and Others are luxury food products, each with an expenditure elasticity greater than unity. However, all-composite food products are estimated to be price inelastic regardless of households being compensated and uncompensated. Furthermore, the estimated cross-price elasticities seem to suggest no strong substitution across various product types. Comparing the estimated elasticities with the existing ones, it was found that almost all the composite food products were in the range except for Meat. And the final purpose is the application of these estimates to the NUDGE model.</div>

### The methods used in this paper: 
* AIDS model, 
* Own and cross-price elasticities, 
* Expenditure elasticities, 
* Separability, 
* Generalized Composite Commodity Theorem, 
* Commodity aggregation.

## AIDS model: 
<div align= "justify"> The “Almost Ideal Demand System” (AIDS) proposed by (Deaton and Muellbauer 1980) is one of the most popular demand systems in empirical demand analysis which has been applied in various fields, especially in general household studies. AIDS is widely used in applied demand analysis because of its various desirable properties: (i) It is an arbitrary first-order approximation to any demand system; (ii) it satisfies the axiom of choice; (iii) it aggregates exactly over consumers without invoking parallel linear Engel curves; (iv) it has a functional form which is inconstant with unknown household-budget data; (v) the homogeneity and symmetry property can be tested and imposed through linear restrictions on fixes parameters.</div> 

## Own and Cross-price Elasticities:
<div align= "justify"> The own price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price. This shows the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to a change in price. And, the cross-price elasticity of demand is an economic concept that measures the responsiveness of demand for one commodity following a change in the price of another related commodity (Petersen 2006). Depending on the sign, cross-price elasticity indicates the relationship between two products. A negative sign indicates a complementary relationship between two products, whereas a positive sign indicates a substitution relation.</div>

## Expenditure elasticities:
<div align= "justify"> A measure of the responsiveness of demand to changes in expenditure on a bundle of similar goods. Shows how the quantity purchased changes (how sensitive it is) in response to a change in the consumer's expenditure, which is a proxy for income. The expenditure is from a bundle of similar goods that can be separated from other goods. Some demand models, such as the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), use budget shares or expenditures on goods and not household income in estimating the demand system.</div>

## Separability: 
<div align= "justify"> Separability is the mathematical property of a function which is a pivotal economic concept that is used to deal with aggregation problems. Weak separability and strong separability are commonly distinguished by economic literature for aggregation purposes.</div>

## Generalized Composite Commodity Theorem:
<div align= "justify"> GCCT justifies aggregation under milder conditions. It relaxes the restriction of constant relative prices within groups by strengthening the requirement that independence holds across all groups (Reed, Levedahl, and Hallahan 2005). It can be tested without specifying a parametric model and in contrast to other aggregation procedures, the early empirical evidence is very encouraging and supports the generalized composite commodity theorem (Lin, C. Davis, and Shumway 2000; Lewbel 1996).</div>

## Commodity aggregation:
<div align= "justify"> In our paper, we have different types of low-level food items aggregated over some higher-level composite food items. However, is it justifiable to use composite food items instead of individual food items? Many papers answer this type of question and justify their answers. There are different theories, among which the most popular one is the Generalized Composite Commodities Theorem (GCCT), proposed by Lewbel (1996). Wang (1997) compared separability, Hicks-Leontief composite commodity theory, and GCCT.</div>

## Findings: 
*	<div align= "justify"> The study shows that all food items had a positive demand income elasticity, indicating that all goods are normal. As the composite foods item fruits and others were expenditure elastic, they are considered a luxury. The remaining composite food items are all income inelastic, indicating necessity. Any increase in a household’s total expenditure would be accompanied by an increase in expenditure on fruits and others with a higher than proportionate increase in total expenditure, implying that an increase in average total household expenditure would lead to an increase in demand for fruits and others greater extent.</div> 
*	<div align= "justify"> The Marshallian and Hicksian's own price elasticity indicates that all food items were price inelastic. However, the cross-price elasticities were very small, indicating a very low degree of complementarities and substitutability among the food items considered in the model and indicating a weak substitution effect of price. Also, directions are ambiguous because of the changing of signs through uncompensated and compensated.</div> 
*	<div align= "justify"> While comparing with other studies, we found that all the expenditure elasticities for different composite food items lay in the range. In addition, almost all own-price elasticities were in the content except meat, which needed further investigation. There are many more studies estimating demand elasticity; however, we have selected some recent studies on Bangladesh as well as different countries with similar food habits as Bangladesh.</div>
*	<div align= "justify"> Effective agriculture and food policy analysis requires a comprehensive view of the sector. Domestic demand and awareness of nutrition can be increased by strengthening publicity through popular mass media like the internet, television, radio, etc. The involvement of political leaders, nutrition specialists, and renowned artists/personnel will be helpful in this aspect.</div>
